# Analyzing-Ecosystem-Services-in-Food-Webs
Example of how to use the data in manuscript XXX.

This repostory includes 2 data files and 1 R file:
1. Final-Full-Edge-List.csv provides the species interactions for all species in these three salt marsh systems (Hechinger et al. 2011) after filtering for Keyes et al. (2021)
2. Final-Full-Node-List.csv provides thefull, filtered species list for all three salt marsh systems (Hechinger et al. 2011) after filtering for Keyes et al. (2021)
2. Using-Data.R is an R file that combines all of these data files to show users how to create and use the data published in XXX to analyze ecosystem services as part of ecological networks.


In order to run this code, you will also need the following files from the data paper XXX:
1. CSM_Links_Final.csv provides the links between ecosystem services and species in Carpinteria Salt Marsh
2. CSM_Nodes_Final.csv provides the information about ecosystem services and the species that provide them in Carpinteria Salt Marsh
3. BSQ_Links_Final.csv provides the links between ecosystem services and species in Bahia Falsa de San Quntin
4. BSQ_Nodes_Final.csv provides the information about ecosystem services and the species that provide them in Bahia Falsa in San Quintin
5. EPB_Links_Final.csv provides the links between ecosystem services and species in Estero de Punta Banda
6. EPB_Nodes_Final.csv provides the information about ecosystem services and the species that provide them in Estero de Punta Banda
